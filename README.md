Trying to write WordPress plug-ins with Chat GPT4

We're just getting started.

We have been using chat GPT to create a chatbot on our website. We have been using it to create multiple choice quizzes for our courses. Now, we are just beginning to work on using chat GPT4 to begin writing PHP code to parse the text files that get generated after we ask for multiple-choice quizzes to be created for a given lesson.
